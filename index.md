### Information

The ONE is a simulation environment that is capable of

* generating node movement using different movement models
* routing messages between nodes with various DTN routing algorithms and sender and receiver types
* visualizing both mobility and message passing in real time in its graphical user interface.
* ONE can import mobility data from real-world traces or other mobility generators. It can also produce a variety of reports from node movement to message passing and general statistics.

The ONE simulator was developed at Aalto University and is now maintained and extended in cooperation between [Aalto University (Comnet)](http://comnet.aalto.fi/en/) and [Technische Universität München (Connected Mobility)](http://www.cm.in.tum.de/index.php?id=5).

### License

The program is released under GPLv3 license. Copyrights of the included map data of Helsinki downtown are owned by Maanmittauslaitos.


### Running (a really quick help)

Download the program. Compile it using your favourite IDE or `compile.bat` (on Windows) or `compile.sh` (on Linux or Mac OS X).

Start a simulation by typing in (Linux/Unix/OS X) terminal:

    ./one.sh

or (in Windows):

    one.bat

After a short while, the GUI should start and a simulation based on default settings should be up and running.

Every simulation run uses the settings from default_settings.txt, if one exists. You can give an additional configuration file(s) as a parameters to define new settings or override the ones defined in default settings. For example:

    ./one.sh example_settings/snw_settings.txt

That would use the (included) snw_settings.txt settings configuration file and change the router for all nodes to Spray and Wait (default is "passive router", i.e., no routing logic). See default_settings.txt for information about the different settings.

If you don't wish to use the GUI, you can run simulations in batch mode using -b option. In batch mode you can also define the number of runs using different run indexes. For example:

    ./one.sh -b 22 example_settings/snw_comparison_settings.txt 

That would run Spray and Wait comparison using 11 different message copy counts and with binary and normal mode. See Settings class' javadoc for details about run indexing.

To create a local copy of the javadoc documentation, run the `create_docs.sh` script in the doc folder.

See the project [README](https://github.com/akeranen/the-one/wiki/README) for more information.
